/// This is an abstract base class for event displays.  
/// Users need to define a class that derives from this class in order to 
/// make an event display.  The only method that users must implement
/// is the method AddAllCanvas(), where the user defines which tabs to use.
/// 
/// The user then needs to define how they what to update and plot histograms.
/// The updating of histograms happens for each event.
/// In online mode, the plotting of histograms only happens for each XX events;
/// for offline mode the plotting happens for each event.
///
/// There are two ways that users can decide to update and plot histograms:
///
/// 1) They can create histograms in their event display class and then fill 
///    the methods UpdateHistograms(TDataContainer) and PlotCanvas(TDataContainer).
///    This histograms can then file in the canvases that are added using 
///    AddSingleCanvas(std::string name).
///
/// 2) They can create classes that are derived from TCanvasHandleBase.  The derived
///    classes are then added using the method AddSingleCanvas(TCanvasHandleBase* handleClass).
///    
/// There is no substantial difference between the two methods.  The second method
/// is mainly meant to allow the user to separate the methods into separate files
/// for code cleaniness.
///
/// Examples of both these methods are available in examples/display_example.cxx
///
/// The actual ROOT GUI is encapsulated in a separate class TMainDisplayWindow.
/// The TRootanaDisplay has an instance of this TMainDisplayWindow class.
/// Users will be need to access the TMainDisplayWindow by calling
///
/// TRootanaDisplay::GetDisplayWindow()
/// 
/// in order to grab the particular canvas that we want plot on.
