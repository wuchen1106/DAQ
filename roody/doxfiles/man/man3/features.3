\fBRoody\fP is mainly a mouse driven application. Using the build-in 'context sensitive' option of ROOT, \fBRoody\fP try to extend this tool by adding it own functions. The canvas generated by \fBRoody\fP are striclty ROOT canvas. All Root object manipulation tools are applicable.
.PP
The internal features of \fBRoody\fP are described below starting from the initial \fBRoody\fP canvas.

.SS "Restore option"
This option is to recover saved online connection and group definitions saved previously through the File->Save pull-down menu. This .XML file can be requested at the execution of the \fBRoody\fP application through \fBargument\fP.
.PP
.PP
 
.SS "Refresh option"
Valid option only for \fBOnline use\fP connection. Allows the automatic refresh of all active GC. Currently the refresh is not disabled while you're picking up the limits for a zoom. In the case the refresh is set to a short time interval this operation (X or Y scaling) is cancelled as the refresh is performed. Make sure to manually disable or extend the refresh option before doing this operation.
.PP
.PP
 
.SS "Zones option"
Predefined zone setting are available from the pull-down menu (2x2, 4x4, etc). Using the grouping method, the zone will be adjusted to fit the number of elements of your group. In the case the group contains a large number of elements, it could be advantageous to 'zoom in' a single element. This is now possible by RMC on the pad of interest and selecting the \fBZoomOption\fP. A 'ZoomOption' has been added to the context menu produced by right clicking anywhere on a histogram frame. This opens up a new canvas, titled 'Zoom
Canvas', containing a copy of the histogram in the original frame.
.PP

.SS "Histogram display"
The procedure to display histogram is independent of the source of the data. In either case \fBOffline\fP or \fBOnline\fP the content of the source will be displayed in a hierarchical structure under the file name Tab. This content can be composed of folders, Tree or Histograms. You can expand the folders by DLMC the Folder Tab. By DLMC on any of the histogram name , a new window (GC) will appear on the back of the SC with the graphical representation of the histogram.

.IP "1." 4
On the GC, standard ROOT options are applicable
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Tool bar can be activated from pull-down menu View->Tool Bar. Provides ROOT icons on the top of the canvas
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Event Status can be activated from pull-down menu View->Event Status. Provides x/y coordinates and bin content of the bin under the mouse (mouse should be on the top of the bin).
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Editor extention can be activated from pull-down menu View->Editor. Provides on the left hand side Editor panel context sensitive to the Right Mouse Click location on the canvas.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Right Mouse click on the different colored zone on the figure below pop up specific set of options. Most used is the X/Y axis for X or Y \fBX/Y Scaling\fP Unzoom.

.SS "X/Y Scaling"
.IP "\(bu" 2
The X or Y scaling (zoom) can be achieved in several ways
.IP "  1." 6
Using the mouse in the X or Y axis region (when hand mouse icon appears) by dragging the mouse along the region of interest.
.IP "  2." 6
Using the Editor extension panel for data selection under Bining.
.PP

.PP
.SS "X/Y-scale limits"
To set the x/y-axis limits, right click anywhere on a histogram frame and choose 'X/YaxisLimits' from the popup context menu. This brings up a dialog box where you can enter the x/ymin and x/ymax values. Click 'OK' and all pads within the currently selected canvas will be redrawn with that x/y-axis scale. To reset all histograms so the x/y-axes are unzoomed, click 'Unzoom'.
.SS "Y-scale freeze"
The y-axis scales can now be fixed just like the x-axis scales. Choose \fBYaxisLimits\fP from the context menu when RMC'ing on a histogram frame and a small dialog box will open in which you can enter the min and max values. If the frame is part of a multipad canvas, all pads on that canvas will be redrawn with the new scales. Choose \fBYaxisLimits\fP again and click on the Unzoom button to unzoom all pads on that canvas.

.SS "Peak Finder"
.IP "\(bu" 2
The option is invoked from the RMC
.PP
.PP
.PP
 
.SH "Group use"
.PP
The intent of the group is to give the possibility to gather multiple histograms under a single group name for fast display. Independently of the number of histograms, when the group is requested for display, the canvas will be split accordingly.
.PP
The procedure to use a group is the following:
.PP
.IP "1." 4
Create a group: RMC on the Group Tab, select \fB Make new group \fP, enter a group name.
.IP "2." 4
Add histogram to a group:
.IP "  \(bu" 4
RMC on the histogram Tab to add to the group, select \fB Add to group \fP select the group to place the histogram into. If only one group is created, the group selection will be omitted.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
For multiple histogram selection, hold the CTL key down while selecting the histograms. When the selection is complete, \fBHold\fP the CTL key \fBand\fP RMC for the \fB Add to group \fP.
.PP

.IP "3." 4
Check a group_name content: DLMC the Group Tab to see the newly created group_name. DLMC the group_name to list its content.
.IP "4." 4
Display a group: RMC on the group_name and select \fB Draw group \fP. This will create a new canvas will zone up to the number of histograms of that group or update a previously displayed canvas of that group_name.
.IP "5." 4
Delete a group_name: RMC on the group_name, select \fB Delete group \fP.
.PP
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
The list of group_name can be saved (\fBSave option\fP) into a file for later restoration (see \fBRestore option\fP)..
.PP
.PP
   
.PP
.PP
 
.SH "Offline use"
.PP
The Offline Tab is to gather all the offline files opened through the \fBRoody\fP application. ...
.PP
.PP
 
.SH "Online use"
.PP
Under the Online Tab, the online connection request will be expended with the corresponding histograms retrieved through this network channel. ...
