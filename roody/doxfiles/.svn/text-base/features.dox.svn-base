Roody is mainly a mouse driven application. Using the build-in "context sensitive"
option of ROOT, Roody try to extend this tool by adding it own functions. The canvas 
generated by Roody are striclty ROOT canvas. All Root object manipulation tools are applicable.

The internal features of Roody are described below starting from the initial Roody canvas.

<hr> @section sc Selection Canvas

The content of the "Selection Canvas" (SC) is composed of 3 main Tabs
  -# @ref group Tab for user defined collection of histograms.
  -# @ref offline Tab for Root or Hbook file.
  -# @ref online Tab for connection to an active analyzer such as the <b> midas analyzer </b> or
     the \b ROME analyzer.
  - The open root file may not contain just histograms but Trees and extra folders can be present too.
    In the case of Trees, by DLMC the Tree Tab, the TreeViewer() from ROOT will be invoked for further 
    manipulation.

The menu list of the Selection Canvas is specific to Roody.
- <b> File </b> 
 - <b> Open data file </b> : Open \em file.root or \em file.hbook. Opened files will be placed
                             under the \em offline Tab in SC (see @ref open).
 - <b> Open online </b> : Open network connection to a running analyzer. Requires host and socket
                          port number for activating the connection. Link to online analyzer will be
                          placed under the \em online Tab in the SC (see @ref online).
 - <b> Save </b> : Save the overall configuration of the Roody application into a XML file description
                   (see @ref save).
 - <b> Restore </b> : Restore from a previously saved XML configuration the Roody settings (see @ref restore)
- <b> Refresh </b> : see @ref refresh
 - <b> Off </b> : Deactivate the automatic histogram content refresh for the \em online connection.
 - <b> Refresh now </b> : Force an update of the current histogram display content for the \em online connection.
 - <b> n seconds </b> : Activate the automatic histogram content refresh based on the time interval selection.
- <b> Zone </b> : see @ref zone
 - <b> j x k </b> : Define the canvas configuration for the upcoming histogram display request.
- <b> Plot in </b> : see @ref plot
 - <b> New Canvas </b> : When selecting a histogram for display, force its appearance in a new canvas. 
 - <b> Current Pad </b> : Replace the current histogram with newly selected one. If no canvas is available,
                          a new canvas with the default zone setting will be created.

<hr> @subsection save Save option
This option provides currently the mean of saving the online connection and the group assignments into a .XML file.
In the future, this option will be extended to include also the GC content and their positions.
The format of the .XML follows the DTD scheme.
\code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE roody SYSTEM "roody.dtd">

  </group>
</roody>
\endcode

<hr> @subsection restore Restore option
This option is to recover saved online connection and group definitions saved previously through the File->Save
pull-down menu. This .XML file can be requested at the execution of the Roody application through @ref argument.

<hr> @subsection refresh Refresh option
Valid option only for @ref online connection. Allows the automatic refresh of all active GC.
Currently the refresh is not disabled while you're picking up the limits for a zoom.
In the case the refresh is set to a short time interval this operation (X or Y scaling) 
is cancelled as the refresh is performed. Make sure to manually disable or extend
the refresh option before doing this operation.

<hr> @subsection zone Zones option
Predefined zone setting are available from the pull-down menu (2x2, 4x4, etc). 
Using the grouping method, the zone will be adjusted to fit the number of elements
of your group. In the case the group contains a large number of elements, it could be
advantageous to "zoom in" a single element. This is now possible by RMC on the pad of
interest and selecting the \b ZoomOption.
A "ZoomOption" has been added to the context menu produced by right clicking 
anywhere on a histogram frame.  This opens up a new canvas, titled "Zoom
Canvas", containing a copy of the histogram in the original frame.


<hr> @subsection plot Plot option
Global selection of the mode of display. This mode can be individualized with a RMC on the histogram Tab.

<hr> @section gc Graphical Canvas
This Graphical Canvas is the result of a DLMC on a Histogram Tab or Group Tab. The composition of this canvas
will be dependent on the mode @ref zone selected...  

<hr> @subsection view Histogram display

The procedure to display histogram is independent of the source of the data.
In either case \b Offline or \b Online the content of the source will be displayed in
a hierarchical structure under the file name Tab.
This content can be composed of folders, Tree or Histograms.
You can expand the folders by DLMC the Folder Tab. By DLMC on any of the histogram name
, a new window (GC) will appear on the back of the SC with the graphical representation
of the histogram.

-# On the GC, standard ROOT options are applicable
  - Tool bar can be activated from pull-down menu View->Tool Bar. Provides ROOT icons on the top of the
    canvas
  - Event Status can be activated from pull-down menu View->Event Status. Provides x/y coordinates and 
    bin content of the bin under the mouse (mouse should be on the top of the bin).
  - Editor extention can be activated from pull-down menu View->Editor. Provides on the left hand side 
    Editor panel context sensitive to the Right Mouse Click location on the canvas.
  - Right Mouse click on the different colored zone on the figure below pop up specific set of options.
    Most used is the X/Y axis for X or Y @ref scaling Unzoom.

<hr> @subsection scaling X/Y Scaling
- The X or Y scaling (zoom) can be achieved in several ways
  -# Using the mouse in the X or Y axis region (when hand mouse icon appears) by dragging the mouse along 
     the region of interest.
  -# Using the Editor extension panel for data selection under Bining.

@subsubsection X-scale_limits X/Y-scale limits
To set the x/y-axis limits, right click anywhere on a histogram frame and choose
"X/YaxisLimits" from the popup context menu.  This brings up a dialog box where
you can enter the x/ymin and x/ymax values. Click "OK" and all pads within the
currently selected canvas will be redrawn with that x/y-axis scale.  To reset all
histograms so the x/y-axes are unzoomed, click "Unzoom".

@subsubsection Y-scale_freeze Y-scale freeze
The y-axis scales can now be fixed just like the x-axis scales.  Choose
\b YaxisLimits from the context menu when RMC'ing on a histogram frame and a
small dialog box will open in which you can enter the min and max values.  If
the frame is part of a multipad canvas, all pads on that canvas will be redrawn
with the new scales.  Choose \b YaxisLimits again and click on the Unzoom button to
unzoom all pads on that canvas.

<hr> @subsection peakfinder Peak Finder 
- The option is invoked from the RMC

<hr> @section group Group use
The intent of the group is to give the possibility to gather multiple histograms under a single group 
name for fast display. Independently of the number of histograms, when the group is requested for display,
the canvas will be split accordingly.

The procedure to use a group is the following:

-# Create a group: RMC on the Group Tab, select <b> Make new group </b>, enter a group name.
-# Add histogram to a group: 
  - RMC on the histogram Tab to add to the group, select <b> Add to group </b>
    select the group to place the histogram into. If only one group is created, the group selection will
    be omitted.
  - For multiple histogram selection, hold the CTL key down while selecting the histograms. When the 
    selection is complete, \b Hold the CTL key \b and RMC for the <b> Add to group </b>.
-# Check a group_name content: DLMC the Group Tab to see the newly created group_name. DLMC the group_name
   to list its content.
-# Display a group: RMC on the group_name and select <b> Draw group </b>. This will create a new canvas
   will zone up to the number of histograms of that group or update a previously displayed canvas 
   of that group_name.
-# Delete a group_name: RMC on the group_name, select <b> Delete group </b>.

- The list of group_name can be saved (@ref save) into a file for later restoration (see @ref restore)..

<hr> @section offline Offline use

Under the Online Tab, the online connection request will be expended with the corresponding histograms
retrieved through this network channel.
